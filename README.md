# Health-and-fitness-database 🏋️‍♀️

This repository encompasses resources for a Data & SQL project that I developed using MySQL as part of a curriculum offered by Code First Girls.

### Course Overview 🗓️
The 8-week introductory course improved my proficiency in MySQL, covering:

- Database creation
- Database design and management
- Techniques for modification and retrieval of data
- Sorting, filtering, and aggregation of data
- Understanding joins, subqueries, and subset unions
- Implementation of stored functions and procedures
- Usage of triggers and events
- Creation and management of views
- Backup and restoration processes
- Data visualization

### Course Project 📊
I created a database for a personal trainer keeping records for their clients. It records user data, nutrition plans, health assessments, daily activity, user workouts, workout plans, and exercises. The healthfitnessdatabase.sql and healthfitnessdata.sql scripts include the code used to create and populate the tables. The corerequirements.sql and advancedrequirements.sql scripts contain the code for executing diverse queries and tasks, such as creating views, stored procedures, and running subqueries, etc. Additionally, the repository holds a backup of the database (trackerbackup.sql). The project was presented to the group using the slides in presentation.pdf.
